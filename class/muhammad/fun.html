        <p> Say you’re doing a site for the Vietnam
                Veterans Memorial in Washington DC. That’s
                a very serious subject. The tone of any war
                memorial is respectful and serious. So your
                color choices should reflect that. Bright
                happy colors would feel out of place, in the
                same way that someone selling balloons near
                the memorial would feel tacky. 
                Also, respect the client’s brand guidelines. If
                you’re doing a microsite for Ikea, it’s likely
                you’ll have to use their signature blue and
                yellow.
                There are some instances when the site
                experience is so far removed from the brand
                that you can use other colors. But before
                doing this, make sure you clear it with your
                creative director or the client.
